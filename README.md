### Abstract

Long-term (press) disturbances like the climate crisis and other anthropogenic pressures are fundamentally altering ecosystems and their functions. Many critical ecosystem functions, such as biogeochemical cycling, are facilitated by microbial communities. Understanding the functional consequences of microbiome responses to press disturbances requires ongoing observations of the active populations that contribute functions. This study leverages a 7-year time series of a 60-year-old coal seam fire (Centralia, Pennsylvania, USA) to examine the resilience of soil bacterial microbiomes to a press disturbance. Using 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we assessed the interannual dynamics of the active subset and the "whole" bacterial community. Contrary to our hypothesis, the whole communities demonstrated greater resilience than active subsets, suggesting that inactive members contributed to overall resilience. Thus, in addition to selection mechanisms of active populations, perceived microbiome resilience is also supported by mechanisms of dispersal, persistence, and revival from the local dormant pool.
