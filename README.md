### Abstract

Soil microbiomes are important mediators of ecosystem services, and their resistance and resilience to anthropogenic disturbances can have profound effects on soil function. However, we know little about the determinants of soil microbiome resilience, especially in the context of long-term (press) disturbances. Here, we utilized the seven-decade-old underground coal seam fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, USA, to examine surface soil bacterial community resilience to long-term heat disturbance. As the fire slowly advances along coal seams, formerly fire-affected soils cool to ambient temperature enabling geographically localized comparisons of impacted soils across a gradient of fire intensities with recovered and reference soils. To assess soil bacterial microbiome response and resilience to the fire, we executed a seven-year field study, annually sampling sites selected to capture the range of disturbance intensities. We examined both whole bacterial communities and their active subsets by applying 16S rRNA and rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and assessing community structure over time across the fire-impact gradient. Over the years, the fire-affected sites cooled, and their microbiome structures generally recovered towards those of reference and recovered soils. However, the whole community demonstrated greater resilience than the active subset, suggesting that resilience could not solely be attributed to environmental selection and growth of active populations. We therefore suggest that regional dispersal and persistence and revival from the local seed bank together contribute to microbiome resilience. Importantly, this work indicates that DNA-based methods alone that do not account for activity may overestimate microbiome resilience, with implications for understanding microbiome functional recovery.
